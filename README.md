# Mapped Table Model

## Overview

This table model is intended to simplify creation of a model and gain experience using lambdas.

Each row in the model represents an object and each cell in that row represents some bit of information from that object.

Lamdas are used to define how information will be extracted from the object to be used by a renderer or editor.
